With Warner Bros. untitled Superman-Batman pic moving to May 6, 2016, Marvel¡¯s ¡°Ant-Man¡± has taken the opportunity to move into its old slot: it will be released on July 17, 2015.

Pic stars Paul Rudd and Michael Douglas as Scott Lang and Hank Pym with Edgar Wright directing.

¡°Ant-Man¡± was slated to bow on July 31. Other pics like ¡°The Dark Knight¡± and ¡°Inception¡± do well in the same slot.

¡°Ant-Man¡± will go up against ¡°Pan,¡± which  jumped from June 26, 2015 to July 17 following the news of Superman-Batman¡¯s move.
