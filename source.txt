The U.N. Climate Change Coordinator for Africa, Richard Munang was one of the speakers. He noted a need to increase food production to feed the population, but he said this must be done without putting more pressure on the environment. He said it is important to find ways to feed people without destroying forests, rivers and seas that provide food. At the meetings, Emmanuel Dlamini served as a negotiator for One Africa. In his opinion, climate change is here to stay, he says African government and farmers have to look for ways to deal with the changes.
